BOOKTOR  App Project  * Business Plan *
University Project to apply the Business Mangment and planning for entrepreneurs Concepts 
---
BOOKTOR is founded in 2021 by a group of software engineering students who aimed to develop the
medical industry by allowing patients to organize and handle their own medical profiles using a simple
mobile application. That way patients would have their medical records safely secured, saved, and
retrievable whenever needed. On the other side, patients’ confidentiality, and medical profile organization
and accuracy is dropped from doctor’s responsibilities.
Mission
Our mission is to simplify the connection between doctors and patients, as well as create a simplified,
portable, and well-organized medical profile accessible for everyone. We aim to be the main medical
application for appointments reservation, and patients and spread health awareness.
Vision
To be a certified all-in-one medical and health consultant application for all patients in Egypt.
